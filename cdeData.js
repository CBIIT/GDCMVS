Approximately 85% are found on the head and neck and the remaining 15% on the trunk and extremities.  Basal cell carcinoma usually grows in a slow and indolent fashion.

As a SERM, 27HC binds to and prevents the activation of estrogen receptors (ERs) in the vasculature. This prevents ER-mediated vasodilation and abrogates the cardiovascular protective effects of estrogen.

Overexpression of this gene is observed in many tumors, which results in chromosome instability and may contribute to tumorigenesis. Cyclin E1 is associated with and involved in the phosphorylation of NPAT protein (nuclear protein mapped to the ATM locus), which participates in cell-cycle regulated histone gene expression and plays a critical role in promoting cell-cycle progression in the absence of pRB. Two isoforms, E1L and E1S, are produced by alternative splicing and E1S cannot complex with CDK2. Cyclin E1 is highly expressed in testis and placenta with low levels in bronchial epithelial cells.

Structurally similar to immunoglobulins, E-cadherin contains five extracellular cadherin repeats, a transmembrane region, and a conserved cytoplasmic tail required for internalization. E-Cadherin acts as ligand for integrin Alpha-E/Beta-7. CDH1 defects cause Familial Gastric Cancer. CDH1 mutations are correlated with breast, colorectal, thyroid, and ovarian cancer. E-cadherin down regulation often correlates with invasive potential and poor prognosis of human carcinomas; it is likely a main event in cancer proliferation, invasion, and metastasis, due to dysfunction of cell-cell adhesion."

In vivo the overexpression of HDAC6 led to a global deacetylation of alpha-tubulin, whereas a decrease in HDAC6 increased alpha-tubulin acetylation. In vitro, purified HDAC6 potently deacetylated alpha-tubulin in assembled microtubules. Furthermore, overexpression of HDAC6 promoted chemotactic cell movement, supporting the idea that HDAC6-mediated deacetylation regulates microtubule-dependent cell motility. Hubbert et al. (2002) concluded that HDAC6 is the tubulin deacetylase, and provided evidence that reversible acetylation regulates important biologic processes beyond histone metabolism and gene transcription.

Beta-1 binds c-Jun; alpha-1, -2, and beta-2 bind c-Jun or ATF2. Inhibited by dual specificity phosphatases, and phosphothreonine/tyrosine activated by a Ras-dependent dual specificity MAP2K4/MAP2K7 cascade, MAPK8 mediates immediate-early gene expression. MAPK8 binds scaffolding proteins MAPK8IP1/2/3. MAPK8/UV-induced apoptosis appears related to cytochrome c-mediated cell death. MAPK8 activation by TNF-alpha induces apoptosis. MAPK8 appears to be required for T-helper cell differentiation into Th1 cells. (NCI)"

DAG markedly increases PKC sensitivity to calcium and phospholipids. PKC activation appears to be central in the induction of cellular responses to many ligand-receptor systems and to external stimuli. After GPCR stimulation, and triggered by PKC-dependent serine phosphorylation, RKIP dissociates from RAF1 to associate with and block GRK2 activity. By activating PKC, the receptor signal may be enhanced by removing a RAF1 inhibitor and blocking receptor internalization. A receptor for phorbol ester tumor promoters, PKC may interact with PRKCABP.

Therefore, elevated levels of ZPP is associated with heme deficiency. Elevated RBC molar ratios of ZPP to heme are indicative of multiple pathologies including lead poisoning, iron deficiency, protoporphyria, and various types of anemia."

These activities prevent calcium overload, increase AMPK-dependent glucose uptake and improve blood flow to the heart. AMPK, a protein kinase complex, regulates several cellular systems including the uptake of glucose, the beta-oxidation of fatty acids, protein synthesis, and the biogenesis of both glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and mitochondria. ADA is a key enzyme involved in purine metabolism."
